The official Nuropedia WordPress plugin empowers website owners to interact with their visitors in real-time by answering queries, scheduling appointments, capturing leads, and much more using Artificial Intelligence.  

== Description ==

Nuropedia is a powerful chatbot that can answer questions without any prior training, thanks to its advanced web crawling capabilities. By scanning your WordPress website, Nuropedia quickly learns about your products and services, and is ready to assist your visitors right away.  You can get started in less than 5 minutes.
Nuropedia simplifies scheduling by syncing your appointments with popular calendar platforms like Google Calendar or Outlook. Plus, you can easily set your availability with the option to block out specific dates and times to keep your work and personal life separate.
Nuropedia helps you acquire valuable leads by engaging your website visitors in a friendly manner, and gathering their name, email, and phone number. This ensures that you have all the necessary information about your audience for future interactions.
With Nuropedia, you have the flexibility to align the chatbot's appearance with your brand's styling by choosing a single color or creating a gradient effect. Additionally, Nuropedia not only answers your visitor's queries but also keeps track of the context of the conversation to personalize future interactions for repeat visitors.
